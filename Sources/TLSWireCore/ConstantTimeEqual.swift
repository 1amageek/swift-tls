/// Constant-Time Comparison
///
/// Prevents timing side-channel attacks by ensuring comparison time
/// is proportional to the data length, regardless of where differences occur.
///
/// Used for verify_data (Finished messages), HMAC tags, and cookie verification.

/// Compare two byte arrays in constant time.
///
/// Returns `true` if and only if both sequences have equal length and
/// identical byte contents. The comparison always examines every byte,
/// preventing timing side-channel leaks.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - a: First byte array to compare
///   - b: Second byte array to compare
/// - Returns: `true` if the sequences are identical
